created directory and changed directory
$git init    #initialize empty Git repository

#config
git config --global user.name "rohit-khaire-edu"
git config --global user.email "test@gmail.com"

created a file and added some lines in it and saved it
$git add demo.txt #to add it to stage area, previously it was in Untracked files

$git status  #Changes to be committed=> new file:demo.txt

$git commit -m "Simple Text"  #commited it

Now git status is nothing to commit

$git config --list   #view config

$git remote add origin "https://github.com/rohit-khaire-edu/test_demo.git"    #add remote repo

$git remote -v  #Verify remote URL

$git push origin master  #push to remote repo
